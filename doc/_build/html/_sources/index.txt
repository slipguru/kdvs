Knowledge Driven Variable Selection (KDVS) provides experimental integration of
numerical data and related prior knowledge, to confirm existing statistically
significant relations between data bits (suggested by prior knowledge), and to
discover new ones. It uses statistical learning algorithms developed by

Informatica, Bioingegneria, Robotica ed Ingegneria dei Sistemi (DIBRIS),
Universit√† degli Studi di Genova, Italy.
