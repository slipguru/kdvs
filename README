See doc/_build/html/index.html

Quick Start
-----------

(*) Linux/OSX

Lets assume the KDVS source archive has been unpacked to:

    ~/KDVS2.0

where '~' indicates the home directory of current user.

Lets execute the example experiment GSE7390. See also 'examples/GSE7390/README'
for more information.

For running KDVS experiment, the results must be stored in writable output directory.
Lets create one:
> mkdir ~/KDVS2.0-results

The experiment can be executed with the following command:

> cd ~/KDVS2.0
> python wrapper.py kdvs/bin/experiment.py -c examples/GSE7390/GSE7390_cfg.py -o ~/KDVS2.0-results

After some minutes, if the run was successful and no error has been reported,
the root output directory ('KDVS_output') and log file ('kdvs.log') shall be
present in the output directory:

> ls ~/KDVS2.0-results
kdvs.log  KDVS_output

IMPORTANT NOTE: KDVS does not overwrite output files and directories. Therefore
the log file ('kdvs.log') and root output directory ('KDVS_output') must be
deleted manually each time the experiment is run with the same output directory.
